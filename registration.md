This year, we are asking for individual registration and payments. We do not impose any restriction for registration but we advise that the problemsets and training level will follow ICPC World Final.

World Finalists and Brazilian Medalists are will not pay the registration fee. Brazilian Computer Society Members will get 20% discount on registration.

If you are a World Finalist or Brazilian Medalists, you must finish your registration on the system **without** payment and send me an email (please, any payment method but do not pay). Do not pay! I will mark your registration as complete without the payment.

We are still finishing our budget. We will define the stipend in January.
