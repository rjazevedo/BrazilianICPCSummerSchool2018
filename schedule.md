This edition will take two weeks, from Monday to Saturday each week (containing one free day per week for our sponsors activities). Each training day will have theory classes and one contest. We expect that the students work on all problems during the school and also discuss through our email lists and local theory classes. We are going to have one different instructor per week.

Our activities will start in the early morning (8:30AM) and go up to 6PM.

For more updated information, go to the [Day-by-day](../daybyday) section.
