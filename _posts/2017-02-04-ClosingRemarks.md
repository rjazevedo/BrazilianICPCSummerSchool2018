The Brazilian ICPC Summer School 2017 was organized by the Brazilian Computing Society and hosted by Unicamp during two weeks from January 23rd to February 4th.

This year, we started with 90 spots in our school and got fully booked in less than 48 hours. Later, we increased the number of spots to 150 and reached a total of 133 students taking part locally. From these 133, 24 students will attend the World Finals in Rapid City - USA.

We could not host this great event without the support of our sponsors: **InMetrics**, **Microsoft**, and **Google**. We had a talk from Microsoft in the morning of January 26th and the Saturday night pizza. We had a talk from Google in the afternoon of January 26h. InMetrics gave a talk and a lunch on February 2nd and also a contest in the afternoon.

Two lectures helped us organizing these weeks, Maxim Akhmedov for the first week and Mike Mirzayanov for the second week. You can learn more about then in our [instructors page](../instructors).

During two weeks, we hosted 10 lectures and 11 contests. If we were to give balloons, there would be 2683 balloons (do not worry, that would only lift about 38Kg if you could connect them together). All lectures and problem discussions were streamed live through [YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLEUHFTHcrJmvwL-QoJ_L2CBMyZmDAA69t). You can review all problemsets and videos in our [Day-by-day](../../daybyday) page. You can submit solutions to all problems through [Codeforces](http://www.codeforces.com).

Our [Facebook page](http://www.facebook.com/maratona) has several pictures of the events.

Behind the scenes we had six student monitors: Celso, Diogo, Igor, Luiz, Paulo, and Rafael, who arrived early and stayed latter than anyone else.

We hope you all enjoyed and have great results in your future programming competitions!
